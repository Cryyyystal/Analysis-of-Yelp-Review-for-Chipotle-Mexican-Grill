# Analysis-of-Yelp-Review-for-Chipotle-Mexican-Grill

**Objectives**

In this project, I aim to apply several natural language processing tools to analyze reviews of Chipotle Mexican Grill on Yelp from 2005 to 2018 to discover improvement rooms and propose suggestions for Chipotle. 

**Structure**

Exploratory Data Analysis
Text Preprocessing
Sentiment Analysis
Word Clouds
Topic Modeling
- Determining the optimal number of topics
- Finding key words for each topic using optimal LdaMallet model
- Determining the dominant topic in each review
- Combining Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis
Pain Point Analysis
- Correlation between the percentage of one single word among positive/ negative reviews and review stars (based on time-series sentiment analysis)

**Recommendations**

To provide customers with better experience, I recommend to Chipotle in the areas of ingredient quality, wait times and digital ordering. 
- Improve the freshness and quality of its ingredients to regain its strategic strength. 
- Investigate the supply chain to see how to improve the quality and taste of its proteins, especially chicken.
- Investigate the current quality of its most important product, burrito, which has gone fewer and fewer positive reviews. 
- Improve online ordering system and mobile app, in order to better solve the wait time problem and improve customers’ buying experience.
